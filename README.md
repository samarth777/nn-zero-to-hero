# Neural Networks Zero to Hero 

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I work through Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks Zero to Hero" tutorials.

## About the Tutorials

Andrej Karpathy's tutorials provide a comprehensive introduction to neural networks, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. They are a great resource for anyone looking to gain a solid understanding of neural networks and their applications.

## Learning Objectives

Through these tutorials, I aim to:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of neural networks
- Learn how to implement neural networks from scratch
- Gain hands-on experience with various neural network architectures
- Apply neural networks to real-world problems

## Progress

I will be updating this section regularly to track my progress through the tutorials.
